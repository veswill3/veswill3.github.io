    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      After university I worked in healthcare IT for five years before my wife and I decided to
      leave everything behind and live our dream of <a href="http://vesperandlaura.com/">traveling
      the world</a>. Thirty-five countries later, I&#39;m back to the real world and have spent the
      past several months getting caught up on everything new.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am now looking to resume my career in web development.
